# A widespread role of alternative splicing coupled with nonsense-mediated decay in accelerating downregulation of non-neuronal genes in developing neurons

This repository contains the scripts used to generate the data
presented in our manuscript. The codes for processing RNA-sequencing data
for gene expression and alternative splicing analyses can be found in the `scripts`
directory. A `.qmd` file with codes to reproduce relevant figures from the manuscript
can be found in the `vignette` directory.
